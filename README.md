# Voice Analysis for Parkinson's Disease Detection

This project is a web application that analyzes voice recordings to detect Parkinson's disease using deep learning. Users can upload .wav audio files, and the app predicts whether the speaker is a young healthy control, elderly healthy control, or a person with Parkinson's disease.

## Features

- **Upload and Analyze**: Simple web interface to upload .wav files for analysis.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify voice samples.
- **Instant Results**: Displays prediction and confidence score.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive and clean design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
